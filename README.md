Here is a summary of my project for Course 8 of the Johns Hopkins Data Science Series
i

Approach: My approach was to explore the data set and analyze what actions best describe how to correctly curl weight. So I explored cleaned and explored the data and used that subset of data to form my models. I did a K fold cross validation, K=20 and I built an qda model and a lda model and had well ok results then I used a random forest model and tuned it to achieve a 98.65% accuracy on my test data.
Conclusion: It was fun to analyze the data myself but I could have used the randomforest to do it. All in all I enjoyed this lab and used all my previous John Hopkins classes to find this success.

The error rate of 100.0 - 98.65 was achieved by exploring the data prior ro building my random forest model. Yes the random forest could have done that but I thought that analyzing the data up front and selecting the data that contributed to measuring the movement was more important than relying on a machine to perform the amalysis.
