Here is a summary of my project for Course 8 of the Johns Hopkins Data Science Series
i

Approach: My approach was to explore the data set and analyze what actions best describe how to correctly curl weight. 
So I explored cleaned and explored the data and used that subset of data to form my models. 
I did a K fold cross validation, K=20 and I built an qda model and a lda model and had well ok results then 
I used a random forest model and tuned it to achieve a 98.65% accuracy on my test data.
Conclusion: It was fun to analyze the data myself but I could have used the randomforest to do it. 
All in all I enjoyed this lab and used all my previous John Hopkins classes to find this success.

An accuracy of 98.95% was achieved by exploring the data prior ro building my 
random forest model. Yes the random forest could have done that but I thought that 
analyzing the data up front and selecting the data that contributed to measuring the movement 
was more important than relying on a machine to perform the amalysis.
